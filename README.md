## Test the game
Here is the [Live Preview](https://elharony.github.io/Udacity-Study-Jam-FEND-P3-Memory-Game/)

## Main Objectives
- Explain the logic of each step
- Write an easy to understand code
- Improve the code step by step

## What to expect?
Idealy, this livestream is targeting the one who can't complete the `Memory Game` project, or even don't know where to start!
The live will start from Downloading the project from the repo, till make it works!

## Does it cover everything?
Almost. Except 3 things:
- `timer`. I've done it separately in a `PDF`, read it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1blJv3xK22ozh80RuUC2iA-9_SGQKsJ9E).
- `modal`
- `shuffle` the cards. It is self-assigned; All you need to do is to use the provided `shuffle` function, then loop through the `icons` after being shuffled!

> Feel free to check my [Memory Game Repo](https://github.com/elharony/FEND-Memory-Game/) to know how I did them! 

## Feedback
This was my first Livestream, or I should say; My first video ever. So, forgive me for its quality. I am open to hear any feedback, so that I can create a better content later.
